# Copilot Process Tracking

For complex multi-step tasks, track progress in `Copilot-Processing.md` file:

1. **Initialize**: Create `Copilot-Processing.md` file with user request
2. **Plan**: Add detailed action items with todo/complete status
3. **Execute**: Complete tasks, marking each done as you go
4. **Summarize**: Add final summary when all tasks complete

**Rules:**
- Work silently - no phase announcements or verbose commentary
- Execute one step at a time
- Update tracking file as you progress
- The user does not need to worry about deleting `Copilot-Processing.md` file when done, it is gitignored
